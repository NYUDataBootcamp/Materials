    "# Advanced Pandas:  Cleaning data \n",
    "\n",
    "Probably the best thing about Pandas is its extensive toolset for managing data. Here we describe features of Pandas that allow us to clean data that, for reasons beyond our control, comes in a form that's not immediately amendable to analysis. This is the first of several such notebooks.  \n",

    "Outline:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* [Want operator](#want).  Start with what we want to end up, then figure out how to get there.  \n",
    "* [String methods](#strings).  Fixing string variables, especially strings that should really be numbers.  \n",
    "* [Missing values](#missing).  Marking, dropping, counting missing values.    \n",
    "* [Selecting variables and observations](#selection).  Choose the variables and observations we want by their labels.\n",
    "* [Boolean selection](#boolean).  This is mostly what we do:  choose observations from conditions.  We use comparisons to produce Boolean variables and then use the Boolean variables to select observations that are `True`.  The next two methods extend this capability.  \n",
    "* [The `isin` method](#isin).  Choose observations whose values are in lists you specify. \n",
    "* [The `contains` method](#contains).  Flag observations that contain a specific piece of text.  Another string method, operates through Booleans.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<!--\n",
    "* [The `query` method](#query).  Similar capability using database syntax.  This is one of many examples in which **SQL database** tools have been built into Pandas.  \n",
